# Mini Projects in Molecular Simulations

This repo contains python code of molecular simulations project on the following topics:

- Generating Polymers using Self Avoiding Random Walk
- Simulating Phase transition phenomena using Ising Model
- Equaton of state for Lennard-Jones Fluid by Monte Carlo simulations

## Deployment

Code for all the projects are written in google colab notebooks. It can be directly accessed via browser.
